# Diabetes Data Exploration
###### Collaboraters: Steve Kennedy, Cole Valentyn, Leslie Trejo, Juliana Park, Kara Simone, Talita Urzeda, Rod Hughes, Lynn Orr, Samuel Gantman, Kelly Hendre

## Plan:

Invoke the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset to provide people who wish to explore and manage their risk factors for diabetes.  The goal of this dashboard is to raise awareness of the user and encourage early detection of risk factors for diabetes. The team will use MongoDB to first establish the database, and JS library, Bootstrap, will be used for visual purposes in the project.  The data components will be tested for correlations and conditional probabilities such as: high blood pressure with diagnosis of diabetes or the probability of diabetes with two simultaneous indicators.  

The dashboard will contain multiple visualizations for the data including a bar chart, gaurge, and line graph.
